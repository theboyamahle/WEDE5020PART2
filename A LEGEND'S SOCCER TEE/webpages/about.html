A Legends Soccer Tee is a South African-based e-commerce retailer that sells personalized soccer jersey for legendary athletes in South Africa.
 It sells t-shirts for current popular players that still have active careers or great players that once walked the pitch
 
 Having a soccer jersey for your favorite club is not exciting anymore especially since kits are only for one season. When a new season starts new jerseys are released therefore,
 this is for fans that have their personal favorite players.
